# DT-Task-2
Scenario 1: Increase in Registrations (City B)

When City B's student registrations increased by 20%, the total rose from 150 to 180 students. In order to make this happen, resource needs were recalculated. This time, facilitators and kits were prioritized based on the number of students. City B was the city with the most students so 4 facilitators and 5 kits were allocated there. One of the kits from City C was reallocated so that City B could have more resources. The workshop for City C was then scheduled later than the other cities to even out the timing and resources. This ensured that City C was not over booked and that the highest quality of workshops would be given. The only negative impact was that City C's workshop was delayed, but City B was able to accommodate all of their students.

Scenario 2:

Following the loss of one venue in City A, workshops had to be held over more days. We had previously been able to hold parallel sessions in two venues, but now City A only had one venue available at a time. To accommodate the 100 students, we held three sessions across three days (to ensure no overcrowding). The City A facilitators and kits were retained for a longer period, which meant they were not available in City C for longer. The key here was to maintain the quality of the session by scheduling them differently rather than reducing service, indicating flexibility in resource allocation.

Scenario 3: Delay in Kit Delivery

As a result of the delay in delivery, three kits only were delivered to the first two days. We ranked the cities by student population to yield the greatest impact initially. City B with the largest number of students was given two kits, and City A received one. City C started once the delayed kit finally arrived on Day 3. This kept disruption to a minimum and most students were active early in the week. The choice weighed urgency against equity, maximizing finite resources and valuing all the cities' interests.
